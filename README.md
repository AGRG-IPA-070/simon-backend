> Back-end interface for SIMON

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

`SIMON` is a powerful, flexible, open-source and easy to use knowledge discovery application.

Currently `SIMON` implements automated machine learning and statistical data discovery features
that will help you to easily illustrate dynamic relationships and provide you with a structural sense of your data.

Goal of this project is to make unified user interface that will empower anyone to extract meaningful information from their data and enable them to rapidly use machine learning algorithms. `It gives you freedom and control over your own data.`

While `SIMON` can be used in across many different fields, 
our focus here is scientific community so we can enable scientist and other researchers in the field to quickly prototype around their data and get meaningful results out of it.
